# Sneaker-Inventory-Management-System-SIMS-

## Why are we doing this?

Having experience buying and selling limited edition Sneakers one of the most important aspects is keeping track of your stock. This CRUD application aims to address the pain points of inventory management in sneaker reselling.

## How I expected the challenge to go.

I expected to code out the functionality of the program relatively seamlessly, however, I expected to run into some issues with testing. 

## What went well / What didnâ€™t go as planned?

Coding out the program went relatively well with little need for refactoring and fixing. Testing proved to be a bit tricky with a few small issues. The main stumbling block turned out to be merging and pushing to GH which is the reason why my most up to date work is in my dev branch.

## Possible improvements for future revisions of the projects

A frontend experience would be a good addition along with some extra functionality. If it were capable to connect to marketplace APIs that would be beneficial too.
